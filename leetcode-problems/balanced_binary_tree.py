"""
Given a binary tree, return true if it is height-balanced and false otherwise.

A height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,null,5]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: root = []
Output: true
