"""
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, where each is sorted in ascending order. 
Return the median value among all elements of the two arrays.

Your solution must run in O(log(m+n)) time.

Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3]
Output: 2.0
Explanation: Among [1, 2, 3] the median is 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2,4]
Output: 2.5
