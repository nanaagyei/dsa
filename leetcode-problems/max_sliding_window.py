"""
You are given an array of integers nums and an integer k. 
There is a sliding window of size k that starts at the left edge of the array. 
The window slides one position to the right until it reaches the right edge of the array.

Return a list that contains the maximum element in the window at each step.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,0,4,2,6], k = 3

Output: [2,2,4,4,6]

Explanation:

 1  2 [1  0  4] 2  6        4
