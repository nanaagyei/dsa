"""
You are given the root of a binary tree root. Invert the binary tree and return its root.

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [1,3,2,7,6,5,4]

Example 2:
Input: root = [3,2,1]
Output: [3,1,2]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
